## Project Description
This C-based prototype program manages basic cybersecurity laboratory information by collecting lab environment data, calculating component and total investments, and generating a formatted report.

## Input
- Lab Name
- Number of Computers
- Number of Network Devices
- Number of Security Tools
- Cost per Computer
- Cost per Network Device
- Annual Security Software Cost

## Processing
- **Computer Cost:** Number of Computers × Cost per Computer
- **Network Cost:** Number of Network Devices × Cost per Device
- **Total Lab Investment:** Computer Cost + Network Cost + Software Cost

## Output
Generates a formatted report titled **CYBERSECURITY LAB REPORT**.

## How to Compile
will be compiled by an IDE such as VScode

## sample output
Lab Name             : Cyber Security Lab
Computers            : 30
Network Devices      : 8
Security Tools       : 12

Computer Cost        : 3000000
Network Device Cost  : 400000
Software Cost        : 500000

Total Lab Investment : 3900000
